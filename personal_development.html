<h1>Personal Development</h1>
<p class="p1">
This page focuses on my personal growth journey, highlighting the lessons, skills, and academic development that shape who I am becoming. It reflects on key principles learned from the book <em>Twelve Pillars</em>, how these ideas apply to my life, and how my degree and skills contribute to my long-term goals. Overall, it demonstrates my commitment to continuous self-improvement, purposeful living, and professional development.
</p>
<section>
    <h2 class="h1">Reflection on "Twelve Pillars"</h2>
    <p class="p1">In Chapters 4 through 7 of Twelve Pillars, Jim Rohn and Chris Widener delve into key principles for personal and professional development which foster individuals to be the best version of themselves. Pillar 4 states that “Work Harder on Yourself Than You Do on Your Job” it stresses the importance of personal growth and stress reduction. Rohn and Widener argue that the foundation for success is not just about excelling in your career but about investing time and energy into improving yourself. This includes reading, learning new skills, and adopting the right mindset, which ultimately helps you become better in your career and life. The authors emphasize that success begins with self-improvement, which makes you capable of tackling all aspects of life.
        Pillar 5 states that “Become a Student of Your Profession” this focuses on the necessity of continuous learning. Success is a result of constant development in your chosen field in order to achieve this the authors recommend seeking out knowledge, whether through reading, attending seminars, or learning from mentors and colleagues. Consequently, by staying curious and committed to growth, you can become a true expert in your profession. In addition Rohn and Widener point out that commitment to learning not only enhances your career but also builds confidence and positions you for greater opportunities.
        According to the text Pillar 6 exhibits that “The Power of Goals discusses how setting clear specific goals are vital for success”. Goals give you direction, and motivation, transforming ambitions into actionable plans whether short term or long term. Additionally, Rohn and Widener emphasize the importance of chunking which refers to writing down goals and breaking them into smaller, manageable steps. Achieving small milestones builds momentum and keeps you on track toward larger, long-term goals. Consequently, the authors argue that without clear goals, it's easy to lose direction, but with them, you are empowered and guided to take deliberate action towards your vision.
        Lastly, Pillar 7 states that “Live with Purpose” this highlights the importance of having a clear sense of purpose and aligning your actions with that purpose. The authors encourage readers to discover their true calling and ensure that every decision they make is in alignment of that larger vision. Consequently, Rohn and Widener suggest that when you live purposefully, your efforts are more focused, and your work feels more meaningful.
        </p>
    <h2 class="h2">Application to My Life</h2>
    <p class="p2">The lessons from these chapters provide valuable guidance that I can apply to my life both now and in the future. Pillar 4 is subsequently relevant as I recognize the importance of working on my personal development alongside my academic studies. By pursuing a degree in Computing, I plan to focus more on building my knowledge and skills outside of the classroom, whether through reading or gaining practical experience in coding. Consequently, This will not only help me grow as a person but will also better prepare me for my future career.
        Pillar 6 emphasizes the power of goals, which I believe can have a significant impact on my success. I already set goals for myself, but I plan to make them more specific and break them down into smaller steps. This will help me stay focused and motivated as I work toward my long-term objectives. Writing down my goals and tracking my progress will provide me with a clearer sense of direction and ensure I stay on track.
        In relation to pillar 7 aligning my actions with my purpose, this is something I will continue to reflect on as I progress through my studies and career. Thus understanding my deeper motivations will help me stay grounded and focused, even when faced with adversities. Consequently, living with purpose will give my work more meaning and ensure that I make decisions that are in line with my long-term vision.

    <h2 class="h3">My Degree</h2>
    <p class="p3">Bachlor in Computing- Computer Science Major</p>

    <h2 class="h4">Top Skills</h2>
    <ul class="p4">
        <li>Programming Languages</li>
        <p>Through coursework and projects, I have gained proficiency in various programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++. These languages have helped me develop a deeper understanding of coding practices, software design, and debugging techniques.
        </p>
        <li>Problem-Solving and Analytical Thinking</li>
        <p>The study of algorithms and data structures has honed my ability to approach complex problems systematically. I have learned how to break down problems into smaller, more manageable parts and apply efficient solutions to solve them.
